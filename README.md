CASE SCENARIO

Workers of a certain company are paid at an hourly rate of 25,000.00 cedis per an hour for regular hours and 1.5 times for overtime hours in a week.
An overtime is when a worker works for more than 40 hours in a week.
The national tax is calculated as follows: If grosspay is below 125,001 cedis then the tax rate is 0%, if the grosspay is between 125,001 and 250,000 cedis then the tax rate is 5%,
if the grosspay is between 250,001 and 1,750,000 cedis then the tax rate is 10%, if the grosspay is between 1,750,001 and 2,750,000 cedis then the tax rate is 15%, 
if the grosspay is between 2750,001 and 5,000,000 cedis then the tax rate is 20% and if the grosspay is more than 5,000,000 cedis then the tax rate is 30%.
There are additional taxes like 6% for social security, 3% for for constituency tax and 2% for welfare conribution.
If an employee has more than 3 dependants, then an amount of 5,000 cedis is paid for each dependant.
This SalaryCalculator calculates the grosspay of the worker, the dedcutions due to taxes and the Total Netpay of the worker.
